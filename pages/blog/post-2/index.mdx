## Chapter 2

All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement).
The work is done, but how no one can see;
'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.

## 第二章

天下皆知美之为美，恶已①；皆知善，斯不善矣②。有无之相生也③，难易之相成也，长短之相刑也④，高下之相盈也⑤，音声之相和也⑥，先后之相随，恒也。是以圣人居无为之事⑦，行不言之教，万物作而弗始也⑧，为而弗志也⑨，成功而弗居也。夫唯弗居，是以弗去。

## 译文

天下人都知道美之所以为美，那是由于有丑陋的存在。都知道善之所以为善，那是因为有恶的存在。所以有和无互相转化，难和易互相形成，长和短互相显现，高和下互相充实，音与声互相谐和，前和后互相接随——这是永恒的。因此圣人用无为的观点对待世事，用不言的方式施行教化：听任万物自然兴起而不为其创始，有所施为，但不加自己的倾向，功成业就而不自居。正由于不居功，就无所谓失去。
