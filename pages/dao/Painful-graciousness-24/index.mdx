## Chapter 24

He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self- conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Dao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Dao do not adopt and allow them.

## 第二十四章

企①者不立，跨②者不行；自见者不明；自是者不彰；自伐者无功；自矜者不长。其在道也，曰余食赘形③。物或恶之，故有道者不处。


## 译文

踮起脚跟想要站得高，反而站立不住；迈起大步想要前进得快，反而不能远行。自逞已见的反而得不到彰明；自以为是的反而得不到显昭；自我夸耀的建立不起功勋；自高自大的不能做众人之长。从道的角度看，以上这些急躁炫耀的行为，只能说是剩饭赘瘤。因为它们是令人厌恶的东西，所以有道的人决不这样做。

## 注释

1、企：一本作“支”，意为举起脚跟，脚尖着地。

2、跨：跃、越过，阔步而行。

3、赘形：多余的形体，因饱食而使身上长出多余的肉。
