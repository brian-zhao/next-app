## Chapter 8

The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Dao. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of words is in their trustworthiness; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him.

## 第八章

上善若水①。水善利万物而不争，处众人之所恶②，故几于道③。居，善地；心，善渊④；与，善仁⑤；言，善信；政，善治⑥；事，善能；动，善时⑦。夫唯不争，故无尤⑧。

## 译文

最善的人好像水一样。水善于滋润万物而不与万物相争，停留在众人都不喜欢的地方，所以最接近于“道”。最善的人，居处最善于选择地方，心胸善于保持沉静而深不可测，待人善于真诚、友爱和无私，说话善于格守信用，为政善于精简处理，能把国家治理好，处事能够善于发挥所长，行动善于把握时机。最善的人所作所为正因为有不争的美德，所以没有过失，也就没有怨咎。

## 注释

①上善若水：上，最的意思。上善即最善。这里老子以水的形象来说明"圣人"是道的体现者，因为圣人的言行有类于水，而水德是近于道的。

②处众人之所恶：即居处于众人所不愿去的地方。

③几于道：几，接近。即接近于道。

④渊：沉静、深沉。

⑤与，善仁：与，指与别人相交相接。善仁，指有修养之人。

⑥政，善治：为政善于治理国家，从而取得治绩。

⑦动，善时：行为动作善于把握有利的时机。

⑧尤：怨咎、过失、罪过。
