## Chapter 23

Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!
Therefore when one is making the Dao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail.
Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Dao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Dao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).

## 第二十三章

希言自然①。故飘风②不终朝，骤雨③不终日，孰为此者？天地。天地尚不能久，而况于人乎？故从事于道者同于道④；德者同于德；失者同于失⑤。同于道者，道亦乐得之；同于德者，德亦乐得之；同于失者，失亦乐得之。信不足焉，有不信焉！

## 译文

不言政令不扰民是合乎于自然的。狂风刮不了一个早晨，暴雨下不了一整天。谁使它这样的呢？天地。天地的狂暴尚且不能长久，更何况是人呢？所以，从事于道的就同于道，从事于德的就同于德，从事于失的人就同于失。同于道的人，道也乐于得到他；同于德的人，德也乐于得到他；同于失的人，失也乐于得到他。统治者的诚信不足，就会有人不信任。
