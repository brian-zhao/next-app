## Chapter 22

The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray.
Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self- display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.
That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken: - all real completion is comprehended under it.

## 第二十二章

曲则全，枉①则直，洼则盈，敝②则新，少则得，多则惑。是以圣人抱一③为天下式④。不自见⑤，故明⑥；不自是，故彰，不自伐⑦，故有功；不自矜，故长。夫唯不争，故天下莫能与之争。古之所谓"曲则全"者，岂虚言哉？诚全而归之。

## 译文

委曲便会保全，屈枉便会直伸；低洼便会充盈，陈旧便会更新；少取便会获得，贪多便会迷惑。所以有道的人坚守这一原则作为天下事理的范式，不自我表扬，反能显明；不自以为是，反能是非彰明；不自己夸耀，反能得有功劳；不自我矜持，所以才能长久。正因为不与人争，所以遍天下没有人能与他争。古时所谓“委曲便会保全”的话，怎么会是空话呢？它实实在在能够达到。
