## Chapter 17

In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Dao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'

## 第十七章

太上①，不知有之②；其次，亲而誉之；其次，畏之；其次，侮之。信不足焉，有不信焉。悠兮③，其贵言④。功成事遂，百姓皆谓“我自然”⑤。

## 译文

最好的统治者，人民并不知道他的存在；其次的统治者，人民亲近他并且称赞他；再次的统治者，人民畏惧他；更次的统治者，人民轻蔑他。统治者的诚信不足，人民才不相信他，最好的统治者是多么悠闲。他很少发号施令，事情办成功了，老百姓说“我们本来就是这样的。”

2、不知有之：人民不知有统治者的存在。
