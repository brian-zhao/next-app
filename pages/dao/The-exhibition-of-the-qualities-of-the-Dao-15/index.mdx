## Chapter 15

The skilful masters (of the Dao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. They who preserve this method of the Dao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.

## 第十五章

古之善为道者①，微妙玄通，深不可识。夫不唯不可识，故强为之容②；豫兮③若冬涉川④；犹兮⑤若畏四邻⑥；俨兮⑦其若客⑧；涣兮其若凌释⑨；敦兮其若朴⑩；旷兮其若谷⑾；混兮其若浊⑿；孰能浊⒀以静之徐清？孰能安⒁以静之徐生？保此道者，不欲盈⒂。夫唯不盈，故能蔽而新成⒃。

## 译文

古时候善于行道的人，微妙通达，深刻玄远，不是一般人可以理解的。正因为不能认识他，所以只能勉强地形容他说：他小心谨慎啊，好像冬天踩着水过河；他警觉戒备啊，好像防备着邻国的进攻；他恭敬郑重啊，好像要去赴宴做客；他行动洒脱啊，好像冰块缓缓消融；他纯朴厚道啊，好像没有经过加工的原料；他旷远豁达啊，好像深幽的山谷；他浑厚宽容，好像不清的浊水。谁能使浑浊安静下来，慢慢澄清？谁能使安静变动起来，慢慢显出生机？保持这个“道”的人不会自满。正因为他从不自满，所以能够去故更新。
