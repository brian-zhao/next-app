## Chapter 13

Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity) - this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it.

## 第十三章

宠辱若惊①，贵大患若身②。何谓宠辱若惊？宠为下③，得之若惊，失之若惊，是谓宠辱若惊。何谓贵大患若身？吾所以有大患者，为吾有身，及吾无身，吾有何患④？故贵以身为天下，若可寄天下；爱以身为天下，若可托天下⑤。

## 译文

受到宠爱和受到侮辱都好像受到惊恐，把荣辱这样的大患看得与自身生命一样珍贵。什么叫做得宠和受辱都感到惊慌失措？得宠是卑下的，得到宠爱感到格外惊喜，失去宠爱则令人惊慌不安。这就叫做得宠和受辱都感到惊恐。什么叫做重视大患像重视自身生命一样？我之所以有大患，是因为我有身体；如果我没有身体，我还会有什么祸患呢？所以，珍贵自己的身体是为了治理天下，天下就可以托付他；爱惜自己的身体是为了治理天下，天下就可以依靠他了。

## 注释

①宠辱：荣宠和侮辱。

②贵大患若身：贵，珍贵、重视。重视大患就像珍贵自己的身体一样。

③宠为下：受到宠爱是光荣的、下等的。

④及吾无身，吾有何患：意为如果我没有身体，有什么大患可言呢？

⑤此句意为以贵身的态度去为天下，才可以把天下托付给他；以爱身的态度去为天下，才可以把天下托付给他。
